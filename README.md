## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first challenge on Frontend Mentor, HTML and JavaScript were fairly easy, CSS took the most time to figure out correctly, will have to come back to it at some point, as I feel that it is very cluttered.

### Continued development

Need to increase my understanding of Flexbox and media query more. Gotta learn a good CSS framework, to save time.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me in understanding flexbox. I really liked the gamification of learning.
